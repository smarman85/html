                What is Pair Programming? Well basically it's two people working together on the same project.
                One developer typically writes the code while the other is the navigator.
                This driver-navigator type pairing provides many benefits.
                The navigator reviews each line of code while it's written and also provides strategic direction. This greatly reduces errors.
                The driver enters the code that the navigator dictates to him/her and since he is not worried about strategic direction he can focus more on the code. '

                Why is Pair Programming important to Dev Bootcamp?
                It's important because pair programming is a increasingly more common practice.
                It benefits both developers in speeding up the development process and enhancing the design quality.
                It's also a great way to learn new tricks!

                The first realy guided pairing session went well. I really liked having someone there who I could bounce ideas off of and get realtime feedback.
